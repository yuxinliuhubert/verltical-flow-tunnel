# Pressure Loss Calculator Tool - Matlab (SI Units)
A Matlab tool calculating the friction pressure loss (head loss) in circular pipes with full flow water, as well useful to compare different solver types or friction factor algorithms (details given in [Features](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/README.md#features)). 

Excel functions (also as add-in) for the same calculator/s can be found in [pressure_loss_calculator-Excel.git](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Excel.git).

## Features
- This Matlab tool has the options in selecting the solver type through the equations either by 'Darcy-Weisbach' or by 'Hazen-Williams'. 
- Besides, another feature in the tool options allows users to select through various algorithms to calculate the Darcy-Weisbach friction coefficient *f*, limited to algorithms by 'Moody', 'Colebrook-White', 'Clamond', 'Swamee-Jain', 'Zigrang-Sylvester', and 'Haaland'. Other algorithms can be found in another repository [mariocastrogama/Colebrook-White](https://github.com/mariocastrogama/Colebrook-White)!
- Aside from the main Matlab tool, two other converter tools are also given to obtain the Hazen-Williams roughness coefficient *C* as a non-steady variable by a function of (i) the absolute roughness of the pipe (also known as ε - eps) and (ii) the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor *f*.
- The limitations for use of equations and algorithms are given in the code (e.g. the operational limitations in using Hazen-Williams).

## Usage
Example scripts are given to illustrate how to use the Matlab tools developed. 

### How2Use the Pressure Loss Calculator Tool
[examplePressureLoss.m](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/examplePressureLoss.m): shows how to use the main Matlab tool [PressureLossCalculator.m](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/PressureLossCalculator.m) with a given data for a pipe segment with different combinations of the solver and the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor algorithms (details given in [Features](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/README.md#features)).

### How2Use the Converter Tools
[exampleRougnessConverters.m](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/exampleRougnessConverters.m): shows how to use the Matlab converter tools with bi-directional examples of use (e.g. conversion of relative pipe roughness (eps/D) to Hazen-Wiliams rougness coefficient (C) as well as conversion from C to eps/D). There are two converter tools: 

- [tConverterDW2HW.m](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/tConverterDW2HW.m): Bi-directional converter between the Hazen-Williams roughness coefficient (C) and the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor (f). 
- [tConverterRoughness.m](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/tConverterRoughness.m): Bi-directional converter between the pipe relative roughness (eps/D) and the Hazen-Williams roughness coefficient (C).

### Darcy-Weisbach Friction Factor Functions
Various Matlab functions can be found for various algorithms, details given below. How2Use each of them can be found in the last section (within switch-case there) of the [PressureLossCalculator.m](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/PressureLossCalculator.m).

- [f_ColebrookWhite.m](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/f_ColebrookWhite.m): Iterative solution of the implicit Colebrook's friction factor expression.
- [f_Clamond.m](https://github.com/DrTol/pressure_loss_calculator-Matlab/blob/master/f_Clamond.m): The explicit approximation (of the Colebrook's friction factor expression) by Clamond D.
